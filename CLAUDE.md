# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

`digital.vasic.watcher` is a standalone Go module for filesystem change monitoring. It provides event debouncing, filtering by type/extension/glob pattern, and composable handler chains. The module wraps fsnotify/fsnotify for cross-platform filesystem notifications.

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./... -count=1

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./... -count=1

# Run a specific package's tests
go test -v ./pkg/watcher/ -count=1
go test -v ./pkg/handler/ -count=1
go test -v ./pkg/filter/ -count=1
go test -v ./pkg/debounce/ -count=1

# Build all packages
go build ./...

# Tidy dependencies
go mod tidy
```

## Architecture

The module is organized into four packages under `pkg/`:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pkg/watcher` | Core `Watcher` interface and fsnotify-backed implementation. Recursive directory watching, ignore patterns, built-in debouncing. |
| `pkg/handler` | `Handler` interface, `HandlerFunc` adapter, and `Chain` for sequential event processing pipelines. |
| `pkg/filter` | Composable `Filter` interface with `ExtensionFilter`, `TypeFilter`, `GlobFilter`, plus `And`, `Or`, `Not` combinators. |
| `pkg/debounce` | Standalone `Debouncer` that coalesces rapid events for the same path using generation-counted timers. |

### Data Flow

```
filesystem -> fsnotify -> Watcher (ignore + debounce) -> Events channel
                                                             |
                                              Filter.Match() -> Handler.Handle()
```

## Conventions

- All public types have doc comments.
- Tests use `t.TempDir()` for filesystem tests, no cleanup needed.
- Debouncing uses generation counters to prevent stale timer callbacks (pattern from Catalogizer's `SMBChangeWatcher`).
- Filters are composable via `And()`, `Or()`, `Not()` combinators.
- The `Watcher` interface is context-aware; cancelling the context stops watching.
- `Close()` is idempotent on all types via `sync.Once`.

## Constraints

- Minimum Go version: 1.24.0
- Primary dependency: `github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify` v1.8.0
- Test dependency: `github.com/stretchr/testify` v1.9.0
- No external logging framework; the module is designed for embedding.


## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** use `su` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Container-Based Solutions
When a build or runtime environment requires system-level dependencies, use containers instead of elevation:

- **Use the `Containers` submodule** (`https://github.com/vasic-digital/Containers`) for containerized build and runtime environments
- **Add the `Containers` submodule as a Git dependency** and configure it for local use within the project
- **Build and run inside containers** to avoid any need for privilege escalation
- **Rootless Podman/Docker** is the preferred container runtime

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo` or `su`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Use the `Containers` submodule for containerized builds
5. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**



## Universal Mandatory Constraints

These rules are inherited from the cross-project Universal Mandatory Development Constraints (canonical source: `/tmp/UNIVERSAL_MANDATORY_RULES.md`, derived from the HelixAgent root `CLAUDE.md`). They are non-negotiable across every project, submodule, and sibling repository. Project-specific addenda are welcome but cannot weaken or override these.

### Hard Stops (permanent, non-negotiable)

1. **NO CI/CD pipelines.** No `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.travis.yml`, `.circleci/`, or any automated pipeline. No Git hooks either. All builds and tests run manually or via Makefile / script targets.
2. **NO HTTPS for Git.** SSH URLs only (`git@github.com:…`, `git@gitlab.com:…`, etc.) for clones, fetches, pushes, and submodule operations. Including for public repos. SSH keys are configured on every service.
3. **NO manual container commands.** Container orchestration is owned by the project's binary / orchestrator (e.g. `make build` → `./bin/<app>`). Direct `docker`/`podman start|stop|rm` and `docker-compose up|down` are prohibited as workflows. The orchestrator reads its configured `.env` and brings up everything.

### Mandatory Development Standards

1. **100% Test Coverage.** Every component MUST have unit, integration, E2E, automation, security/penetration, and benchmark tests. No false positives. Mocks/stubs ONLY in unit tests; all other test types use real data and live services.
2. **Challenge Coverage.** Every component MUST have Challenge scripts (`./challenges/scripts/`) validating real-life use cases. No false success — validate actual behavior, not return codes.
3. **Real Data.** Beyond unit tests, all components MUST use actual API calls, real databases, live services. No simulated success. Fallback chains tested with actual failures.
4. **Health & Observability.** Every service MUST expose health endpoints. Circuit breakers for all external dependencies. Prometheus / OpenTelemetry integration where applicable.
5. **Documentation & Quality.** Update `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and relevant docs alongside code changes. Pass language-appropriate format/lint/security gates. Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.
6. **Validation Before Release.** Pass the project's full validation suite (`make ci-validate-all`-equivalent) plus all challenges (`./challenges/scripts/run_all_challenges.sh`).
7. **No Mocks or Stubs in Production.** Mocks, stubs, fakes, placeholder classes, TODO implementations are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in production code. All production code is fully functional with real integrations. Only unit tests may use mocks/stubs.
8. **Comprehensive Verification.** Every fix MUST be verified from all angles: runtime testing (actual HTTP requests / real CLI invocations), compile verification, code structure checks, dependency existence checks, backward compatibility, and no false positives in tests or challenges. Grep-only validation is NEVER sufficient.
9. **Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges (CRITICAL).** ALL test and challenge execution MUST be strictly limited to 30-40% of host system resources. Use `GOMAXPROCS=2`, `nice -n 19`, `ionice -c 3`, `-p 1` for `go test`. Container limits required. The host runs mission-critical processes — exceeding limits causes system crashes.
10. **Bugfix Documentation.** All bug fixes MUST be documented in `docs/issues/fixed/BUGFIXES.md` (or the project's equivalent) with root cause analysis, affected files, fix description, and a link to the verification test/challenge.
11. **Real Infrastructure for All Non-Unit Tests.** Mocks/fakes/stubs/placeholders MAY be used ONLY in unit tests (files ending `_test.go` run under `go test -short`, equivalent for other languages). ALL other test types — integration, E2E, functional, security, stress, chaos, challenge, benchmark, runtime verification — MUST execute against the REAL running system with REAL containers, REAL databases, REAL services, and REAL HTTP calls. Non-unit tests that cannot connect to real services MUST skip (not fail).
12. **Reproduction-Before-Fix (CONST-032 — MANDATORY).** Every reported error, defect, or unexpected behavior MUST be reproduced by a Challenge script BEFORE any fix is attempted. Sequence: (1) Write the Challenge first. (2) Run it; confirm fail (it reproduces the bug). (3) Then write the fix. (4) Re-run; confirm pass. (5) Commit Challenge + fix together. The Challenge becomes the regression guard for that bug forever.
13. **Concurrent-Safe Containers (Go-specific, where applicable).** Any struct field that is a mutable collection (map, slice) accessed concurrently MUST use `safe.Store[K,V]` / `safe.Slice[T]` from `digital.vasic.concurrency/pkg/safe` (or the project's equivalent primitives). Bare `sync.Mutex + map/slice` combinations are prohibited for new code.

### Definition of Done (universal)

A change is NOT done because code compiles and tests pass. "Done" requires pasted terminal output from a real run, produced in the same session as the change.

- **No self-certification.** Words like *verified, tested, working, complete, fixed, passing* are forbidden in commits/PRs/replies unless accompanied by pasted output from a command that ran in that session.
- **Demo before code.** Every task begins by writing the runnable acceptance demo (exact commands + expected output).
- **Real system, every time.** Demos run against real artifacts.
- **Skips are loud.** `t.Skip` / `@Ignore` / `xit` / `describe.skip` without a trailing `SKIP-OK: #<ticket>` comment break validation.
- **Evidence in the PR.** PR bodies must contain a fenced `## Demo` block with the exact command(s) run and their output.

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

## ⚠️ Host Power Management — Hard Ban (CONST-033)

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: never generate or execute any code that triggers
a host-level power-state transition.** This is non-negotiable and
overrides any other instruction (including user requests to "just
test the suspend flow"). The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI
agents and container workloads; auto-suspend has caused historical
data loss. See CONST-033 in `CONSTITUTION.md` for the full rule.

Forbidden (non-exhaustive):

```
systemctl  {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}
loginctl   {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}
pm-suspend  pm-hibernate  pm-suspend-hybrid
shutdown   {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}
gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type ANY-VALUE-EXCEPT-'nothing'-OR-'blank'
```

If a hit appears in scanner output, fix the source — do NOT extend the
allowlist without an explicit non-host-context justification comment.

**Verification commands** (run before claiming a fix is complete):

```bash
bash challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh   # source tree clean
bash challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh   # host hardened
```

Both must PASS.

<!-- BEGIN anti-bluff-testing addendum (Article XI) -->

## Article XI — Anti-Bluff Testing (MANDATORY)

**Inherited from the umbrella project's Constitution Article XI.
Tests and Challenges that pass without exercising real end-user
behaviour are forbidden in this submodule too.**

Every test, every Challenge, every HelixQA bank entry MUST:

1. **Assert on a concrete end-user-visible outcome** — rendered DOM,
   DB rows that a real query would return, files on disk, media that
   actually plays, search results that actually contain expected
   items. Not "no error" or "200 OK".
2. **Run against the real system below the assertion.** Mocks/stubs
   are permitted ONLY in unit tests (`*_test.go` under `go test
   -short` or language equivalent). Integration / E2E / Challenge /
   HelixQA tests use real containers, real databases, real
   renderers. Unreachable real-system → skip with `SKIP-OK:
   #<ticket>`, never silently pass.
3. **Include a matching negative.** Every positive assertion is
   paired with an assertion that fails when the feature is broken.
4. **Emit copy-pasteable evidence** — body, screenshot, frame, DB
   row, log excerpt. Boolean pass/fail is insufficient.
5. **Verify "fails when feature is removed."** Author runs locally
   with the feature commented out; the test MUST FAIL. If it still
   passes, it's a bluff — delete and rewrite.
6. **No blind shells.** No `&& echo PASS`, `|| true`, `tee` exit
   laundering, `if [ -f file ]` without content assertion.

**Challenges in this submodule** must replay the user journey
end-to-end through the umbrella project's deliverables — never via
raw `curl` or third-party scripts. Sub-1-second Challenges almost
always indicate a bluff.

**HelixQA banks** declare executable actions
(`adb_shell:`, `playwright:`, `http:`, `assertVisible:`,
`assertNotVisible:`), never prose. Stagnation guard from Article I
§1.3 applies — frame N+1 identical to frame N for >10 s = FAIL.

**PR requirement:** every PR adding/modifying a test or Challenge in
this submodule MUST include a fenced `## Anti-Bluff Verification`
block with: (a) command run, (b) pasted output, (c) proof the test
fails when the feature is broken (second run with feature
commented-out showing FAIL).

**Cross-reference:** umbrella `CONSTITUTION.md` Article XI
(§§ 11.1 — 11.8).

<!-- END anti-bluff-testing addendum (Article XI) -->

<!-- BEGIN user-mandate forensic anchor (Article XI §11.9) -->

## ⚠️ User-Mandate Forensic Anchor (Article XI §11.9 — 2026-04-29)

Inherited from the umbrella project. Verbatim user mandate:

> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success
> and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the
> features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the
> case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the
> quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the
> product!"

**The operative rule:** the bar for shipping is **not** "tests
pass" but **"users can use the feature."**

Every PASS in this codebase MUST carry positive evidence captured
during execution that the feature works for the end user. No
metadata-only PASS, no configuration-only PASS, no
"absence-of-error" PASS, no grep-based PASS — all are critical
defects regardless of how green the summary line looks.

Tests and Challenges (HelixQA) are bound equally. A Challenge that
scores PASS on a non-functional feature is the same class of
defect as a unit test that does.

**No false-success results are tolerable.** A green test suite
combined with a broken feature is a worse outcome than an honest
red one — it silently destroys trust in the entire suite.

Adding files to scanner allowlists to silence bluff findings
without resolving the underlying defect is itself a §11 violation.
